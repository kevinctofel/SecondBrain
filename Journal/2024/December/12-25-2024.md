Althoug I didn't update yesterday's journal after 7pm or so, I did spend another 1.5 hours reading Franklin's Autobigraphy. Very enjoyable and interesting how he planned his days with far more rigidity that most of us do today. 

My approach of timeboxing tasks and activities on my calendar does fit nicely here. I'll continue to do this throughout 2025 as it has served me well... when I pracitice it faithfully, that is.

Some of his writing inspired me to look deeper into his life. I shouldn't be surprised to learn that Franklin was a Freemason. I've long considered presenting myself to this organization as, based on what little I know about it, fits nicely with my own beliefs and virtues, i.e.; honesty, integrity, helping others in need, etc.. I am not aware that any of my contacts or acquaintances are Masons, so I'll have to keep an eye out.

In a related thought, [Franklin devised 13 virtues](https://fs.blog/the-thirteen-virtues/) that I readily identify with. Interesingly he created his own written "habit tracker" type of journal to track when he deviated from these.
