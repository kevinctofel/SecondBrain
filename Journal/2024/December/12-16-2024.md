I wasn't scheduled for work today but put four hours in. Someone on the 6am to 2pm shift had an appointment, so I covered their shift from 10am on. We've been selling a **ton** of Wawa gift cards. I'm sure I did at least $600 worth in just the four hours I was there.

Interesting videos / shows I watched:

- [Black Doves on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81682935). Some initial reviews I read were "meh" at best. I'm glad I watched it though. Throughout the 6 episode season, I enjoyed the thrilling nature of the plot, which even included some snarky humor that made me laugh. Sure people might not think of Kiera Knightly as a convincing spy. I get that. I think she pulled it off quite well though.

- [The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition](https://youtu.be/jD1mNA4Efcw?si=M6XSMOFf7tpW9Rsa) I remember modding the original Doom game about 30 years ago. My how far we've come. The Witcher 3 was already one of my favorite titles and this massive (11 GB!) set of mods makes it look even more incredible. After watching the before and after comparisons, I downloaded the mod files. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to install or use them yet due to work.
