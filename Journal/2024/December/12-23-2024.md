No journaling for the last two days even though yesterday I was off from work. Off today as well. However, I did spend some time writing [my weekly review blog post](https://myconscious.stream/blog/Week-in-review-Dec-22-2024/) yesterday, so not a total loss.

Yesterday, I found out you can purchase [a Kindle edition of the entire Harvard Classics 51 volume set for $1.99](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Harvard-Classics-Eireann-Press-ebook/dp/B076PKKZ22). I snagged it since the hardbound editions will run you $1,400 new. 

Book one is Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, so this morning after making a cup of coffee, I settled down to start reading. Aside from being very interesting in general, I'm already realizing how much of Franklin's early life led him to appreciate frugality. This isn't a massive revelation, of course. However, it ties in nicely to the minimalism approach I use in my life. 

Also, I found that I spent around an hour reading over that single cup of coffee. This might be a smart reading strategy on days I'm not working the morning shift: Read over that first cup of coffee.
