No journaling for the last two days even though yesterday I was off from work. Off today as well. However, I did spend some time writing [my weekly review blog post](https://myconscious.stream/blog/Week-in-review-Dec-22-2024/) yesterday, so not a total loss.

Yesterday, I found out you can purchase [a Kindle edition of the entire Harvard Classics 51 volume set for $1.99](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Harvard-Classics-Eireann-Press-ebook/dp/B076PKKZ22). I snagged it since the hardbound editions will run you $1,400 new. 

Book one is Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, so this morning after making a cup of coffee, I settled down to start reading. Aside from being very interesting in general, I'm already realizing how much of Franklin's early life led him to appreciate frugality. This isn't a massive revelation, of course. However, it ties in nicely to the minimalism approach I use in my life. 

Also, I found that I spent around an hour reading over that single cup of coffee. This might be a smart reading strategy on days I'm not working the morning shift: Read over that first cup of coffee.

I asked other homelabbers on Mastodon what phones / software they use. We spend so much time taking back control of our data and services with homelabs but it's hard to do the same with a smartphone.

[This response](https://im-in.space/@etam/113702660190295002) shed light on a potential solution, which is [LineageOS with MicroG](https://lineage.microg.org). I have both a OnePlus 7 and a Pixel 7 that could run this. I was hoping for a "pure" Linux solution (with Waydroid for Android apps) but for now, this might be the best option. Something to tinker with as time allows.
