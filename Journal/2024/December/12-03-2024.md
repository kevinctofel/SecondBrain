After getting [[Software/Wallabag]] as a web-clipping / read it later app on the home server yesterday, I used this positive momentum to install [[Software/Immich]] on the mini PC. Immich is a self-hosted, private app that replicates much of the Google Photos experience. Of course, Google doesn't get any of the data from your photos with Immich. 

The application has some great features, including facial recognition, support for photo places, albums, sharing and more. There's a mobile app to sync local photos from your phone to the server as well. I used the app to sync more than 3,200 images and videos from my iPhone to the homelab server and it all went without a hitch.

I also testing photo/album sharing. Immich lets you share privately with other users on the server or publicly to anyone. You can even have the public share link expire at a certain date and time. Nice!

Transition of my _kctofel.com_ domain from SquareSpace to Cloudflare is moving along. I configured all of the DNS / Name Server settings on Cloudflare in two minutes. Then requested a domain transfer code from SquareSpace, which I received in about 12 hours. Entered the code into Cloudflare to start the transfer and it should take place in roughly five days.

Installed the Git plugin for Obsidian and pointed a vault to the Git repo for this site. I'm now able to use Obsidian as the front end for my second brain and journaling, which is super handy!
