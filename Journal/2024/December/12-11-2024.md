## December 11, 2024

Worked a 6am to 2pm shift on the register today. Surprisingly did over 11,000 steps, or just shy of 5 miles. That's mainly because I delivered several curbside orders and filled a flurry of mobile orders during the lunch rush. Customers were fun today, which makes it all worth it.

During some downtime at work, I installed and tested the [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) app for iOS. Honestly, I was blown away. The voices sound more realistic than from any other AI app I've ever heard. And the information provided from question after question was timely and spot on.

Aside from being very conversational in nature, Gemini seems to really provide useful information with a simple voice prompt. More to follow as I continue testing. And the iOS 18.2 arrived on my iPhone today so I'll be informally testing and comparing these competing AI platforms.

Videos I enjoyed today:

- [10 Nordic Secrets to keep your life calm and balanced](https://youtu.be/7Mle2uQK1ps?si=ddi31NHucXpliGOM) I always enjoy getting perspective on simple, intentional living from other areas of the word. And frankly, the Nordic countries have this framework down to a science. That's why countries in this region are named the happiest places in the world year after year. While some of the "secrets" are hard to translate into actionable activities in a different climate, most of them can be modified to fit anywhere

- [How to read the latest Linux Arch news](https://youtu.be/SPUrRh3ryAE?si=qUrw-eo1q0yFlDNJ) It sounds like an obvious video, i.e.: just hit the Linux Arch home page on a regular basis. And of course that works. But who does that? Not even people like me who run Arch Linux (BTW). So I appreciated some of the built in commands and third-party packages that make it simpler to read up on my favorite Linux distro... right from within a terminal in Arch Linux.
