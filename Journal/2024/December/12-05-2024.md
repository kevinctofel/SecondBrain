On one hand, I‚Äôd think more consumers would want self-hosted services / data on their own server running FOSS.

On the other hand, having used some of the available server software, I can see why ‚Äúmere mortals‚Äù can‚Äôt do this, or get try to do it and get overwhelmed.

Guess the current solution is a pre-built NAS with proprietary software atop Linux? But is that the *best* solution on the market? Is there room for better options that don‚Äôt require a computer science degree? ü§î

I need a way to easily send notes from my phone to this site. I'm sure some open source options exist. Could always code something up using Node.js to add notes to an "inbox" in this Github repo for later usage.
