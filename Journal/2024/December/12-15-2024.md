## December 15, 2024

As expected, working 8am to 4pm yesterday tired me out. Only 4.5 miles of walking as I was mostly on the register but I was still beat when I got home. So no tech or other work got done. I really need to figure out how to keep energy levels up after work so I can be more productive.

I was able to resurrect some old code from November 2023 this morning though. I had been using NodeJS and the Github API to create a basic CMS, or content management system for my blog posts. All post data is stored in a Github repo using Markdown files. But I wanted a way to update and create these files via a web interface. I had the basics working and for what I want to do now, that's enough.

With a few minor code changes, I now have a web interface to the journal entries on this very site. The code gathers posts in the December folder (for now) and displays the titles. I don't care much about that; the more important part is that I can create a new note in that folder for testing.

Here's a shot of the terrible web interface, followed by an image of the published note / journal entry, which appeared online roughly 30 seconds later.
