## December 13, 2024

Worked another 6am to 2pm shift and walked an average 4.5 miles over roughly 10,000 steps. Being Friday the 13th, there were some anomolies throughout the day. Our mobile ordering system was down for at least 4 hours, for example. And some strange personalities took over a few customers. Whatever. It made the day interesting.

- [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: Before you buy](https://youtu.be/0oj88MivbHc?si=WHuvIalJLzMTyrfW) I've been waiting all year to see actual gameplay of the new Indiana Jones game title and wow. Looks like it was well worth the wait. According to this review, there's a great blend of gameplay, puzzle solving and exploring, which is my kind of game. I'm not up for paying $70 during launch week so I'll wait for a decent sale and see if I can get this title for my gaming PC within the next 6 months at a reasonable discount.

- [The Witcher IV Cinematic Trailer](https://youtu.be/54dabgZJ5YA?si=g-sjnR69trq8NcY9) Sticking with video game theme, a cinematic trailer for the next Witcher game dropped this week. With the Witcher 3 being one of my all-time favorate titles, this is another one I've been looking forward to. I don't want to get too excited about it though for two reasons. First, this isn't a gameplay trailer. It's more like a movie scene to illustrate the story atop the Unreal 5 game engine used for the game. And second: There's no release date yet. My best guess is late 2026 at the earliest.
