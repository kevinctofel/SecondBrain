How did I not know about [Wttr](https://wttr.in), a command line weather app? To get local weather, it's just a simple 

```bash
curl wttr.in
```

In the above example, I followed the server name with a slash and my town name. Easy to alias for simple usage too. I do have (and use) a weather widget in the top left bar of Hyprland, which has worked well. But it's always nice to have a simple command line option for current and future weather since I'm in a terminal most of the time.
