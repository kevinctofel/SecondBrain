How did I not know about [Wttr](https://wttr.in), a command line weather app? To get local weather, it's just a simple 

```bash
curl wttr.in
```

In the above example, I followed the server name with a slash and my town name. Easy to alias for simple usage too. I do have (and use) a weather widget in the top left bar of Hyprland, which has worked well. But it's always nice to have a simple command line option for current and future weather since I'm in a terminal most of the time.

Decided to get out of the house and still tackle my Asteriods assignment in Python. Headed to Starbucks and two hours later, got the final version working. 

Today I added:
- Collision detection between bullets and any asteroids
- Splitting large asteroids into two smaller ones with more velocity and in two random vectors
- Removing any asteroid hit by a bullet

This block of time was challenging. The collision detection was relatively easy since I already had a function for this. I simply had to use it with any bullets and asteroids. I was already using it for detecting a player collision with any asteroid. The harder part was removing any asteriods hit by a bullet (and removing the bullet too from the display) and spawning two smaller asteroids. In the end this was time well spent.
