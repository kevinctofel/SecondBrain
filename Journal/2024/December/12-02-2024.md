Got to watch yesterday's Arizona Cardinals game this morning against the Vikings. So close but a one point loss. Have to wonder what would have happened if Arizona went on 4th and goal from the 5 yard line late in the game. Kicking a field goal was the safer play but perhaps not the best.

Found out my beloved read it later app, [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/home) began [shutting down operations this week](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/details-on-omnivore-shutting-down). Very disappointed because I really liked the service. There is some work being done to offer a self-hosted version but I may look at [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/), a recommended open source alternative that can already be self hosted. I was just about to research / build some integration between Omnivore and Obsidian for my second brain.

As expected, it took all night for UNRAID to setup the parity drive on my homelab server, having started to do so yesterday. I was able to install the SearXNG Docker container so I have my personal search engine back. Additionally, I re-configured my Cloudflare Tunnel so SearXNG is available through my own custom domain. Since the homelab is now fully operational, I have a place to self-host Wallabag.

So I installed Wallabag on the homelab server about 2 hours after writing about the closure of Omnivore. What can I say? I'm an impatient man with an underutilized homelab server. 🤣 The UNRAID app catalog had a Docker image available, which I installed. I had to tweak a few things to get it working but it does work.

It's not quite working remotely through my Cloudflare Tunnel yet, but I'll deal with that later. First I want to get used to saving content to the self-hosted service and better understand how to use it.

More great videos watched today:

- [World's first selfie from space](https://youtu.be/6KcV1C1Ui5s?si=X9Eb00qjSX6mkn0e) Not only is this a cool project where you can get your own selfie from a satellite launching next month but the video describes the entire process of designing and building the satellite as well. Outstanding!

- [Advent of Neovim](https://youtu.be/TQn2hJeHQbM?si=rRZGrcHojCxS5yIB) TJ Devries is sharing a special holiday gift this year: A Neovim video every day during Advent. This one, from yesterday, is the first one and starts as a gentle introduction to this excellent text editor. I watched today's as well and even though I use [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) as my editor, I'll watch this entire series in December.
