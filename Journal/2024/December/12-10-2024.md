## December 10, 2024

No journal yesterday. I worked a 6am to 2pm shift and basically chilled out, which is good and bad.

Good because it was relaxing. Bad because I had planned to do some things. I really wanted to start on a web app to capture notes that I can send to GitHub for my second brain. I definitely need to try harder on work days to get some projects done instead of napping or watching videos.

The ESR Qi2 3-in-1 charger I ordered over the weekend arrived. So far, it's excellent and has a hidden feature I wasn't aware of.

For starters, I love the quiet cooling fan. It lights up blue when a phone is attached and you can barely hear the fan. The idea is to keep the phone cooler so that the charging rate doesn't throttle. 

Perhaps the best part is the Apple Watch charger on the back. Technically, this is a separate product but it comes with the 3-in-1 model.

It's a small USB-C charging pad that plugs directly into the back of the charger. However, you can use it as a travel charger on the go with any USB-C port. Love it!

I noticed that this note from 10/10/2024 appears prior to all of the single digit notes. I'll have to address this sorting issue in the coming days in the queries 11ty uses to generate the static pages.
