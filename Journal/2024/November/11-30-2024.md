- Started to migrate the homelab server from TrueNAS to UNRAID. Unfortunately, my USB drive with UNRAID isn't booting the homelab server. May need a new drive and fresh install. Once UNRAID is running, the first thing I'll do is install a server instance of SearcXNG.

- Set up [Eleventy Notes](https://eleventy-notes.sandroroth.com/) on my desktop as my second brain. The idea is to eventually use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to add data and daily journals.

- Watched ASU run over Arizona for the Territorial Cup. The Sun Devils are likely to be in the BIG12 Championship Game as a result.

- Wrote a [week in review blog post](https://myconscious.stream/blog/Week-in-review-Nov-30-2024/) on my personal site.
