Way too much work in the past week for any journaling. Off today and already put in 1.5 hours on my ASU programming class though. Also: finished The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklyn by reading at night in bed before dozing off over the past week. 

I was very disappointed to hear about / read some of the [Proton CEO comments about big tech and politics](https://www.redditmedia.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/1i2nz9v/on_politics_and_proton_a_message_from_andy/). Unfortunately, moving to another platform isn't a great option since I just renewed my Proton account for 2 years back in November. I'll still look for alternative, secure platforms for my mail and personal storage moving forward however.
