After much research, I decided to downgrade from the M1 iPad Pro 12.9 to the new M4 iPad Pro 11. I explain why in my weekly blog post. So far, as a tablet, this is an incredible device. No regrets. We'll see if I change my tune once the Magic Keyboard arrives on Wednesday because I need both a tablet and a comfortable casual computer.

My [intro programming class at ASU](https://courses.ea.asu.edu/principles-of-programming-cse-110/) starts on Tuesday. Really looking forward to it. Not just because it will solidify my foundational knowledge but (and the reason I'm taking it) also because I want to help the students as much as I can.

I just noticed that images aren't appearing in my last two journal entries even though I'm using the proper Markdown format. Either something changed with the Eleventy Notes template I use (doubtful) or something changed in how CloudFlare builds the HTML pages. 

I can see them on the Github previews of each entry so I'm thinking the latter is the issue. I'll have to do some research.
