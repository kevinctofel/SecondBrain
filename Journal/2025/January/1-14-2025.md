Although I wasn't scheduled to work today, I got called in for a 6am to 2pm shift. The day went pretty fast so it was no big deal. Have to be back in at 5am tomorrow though, so it will be an early night.

The Magic Keyboard for my new iPad Pro 11 was expected tomorrow. It arrived a day early, so after work I drove over to the Apple Store. I haven't used it much, although I'm using it now for this journal entry.

It's about as small as I'd want a keyboard to be. I don't really feel cramped but it is tight. The build quality is much better than the old model. The keys have a much nicer feel and sound too.

The last few journal entries weren't showing images and I think I figured out why. I often upload images to this repo using an iPad and noticed that the "Most Compatible" format option wasn't checked. I enabled that format and re-uploaded the images that weren't loading. Problem solved!

I'm stuck on the latest Functional Programming assignemtn for my Boot.dev class. However, I realized something while taking a shower tonight: I think I have the data in the program backwards.

The idea is to submit a document extension to the app and have it return the type of object it is: i.e.; image, document, etc....

So I have a set of extensions that map to different object types. A .doc and a .docx file, for example, should indicate "document". I set up the data as key value pairs however, some file objects have multiple extensions, such as the above example. However, [key value pairs in a Python dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) require that keys be unique and I'm running into issues with my current approach. I think I have to reverse the keys and values; will try it during my next coding session.
