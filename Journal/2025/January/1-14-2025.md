Although I wasn't scheduled to work today, I got called in for a 6am to 2pm shift. The day went pretty fast so it was no big deal. Have to be back in at 5am tomorrow though, so it will be an early night.

The Magic Keyboard for my new iPad Pro 11 was expected tomorrow. It arrived a day early, so after work I drove over to the Apple Store. I haven't used it much, although I'm using it now for this journal entry.

It's about as small as I'd want a keyboard to be. I don't really feel cramped but it is tight. The build quality is much better than the old model. The keys have a much nicer feel and sound too.
