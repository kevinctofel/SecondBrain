No work shift scheduled today so I can get some tech work, and some journaling, done. ðŸŽ‰

Spent a few hours watching the first three episodes of ["The Last Kingdom"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4179452/), season 3, with Tyler last night. Such a great story with just enough complexity to make it super intriguing. This season starts out showing Uhtred's inner turmoil between Saxon and Dane loyalties.

Didn't know you could do live wallpapers on Linux until I heard today about [Hidamari](https://github.com/jeffshee/hidamari). I like to stream ambient videos from YouTube to relax and figured this would be ideal. Unfortunately, because I use Wayland on Arch, the videos don't open as live wallpapers but as separate windows in Hyprland. It's a [known issue](https://github.com/jeffshee/hidamari/issues/113) but still a bummer.

[Here's a video demonstrating Hidamari on X11](https://youtu.be/cRMsqFh1lYM?si=I1hxa9HxIinJkU9d).

After 10 days of tracking my calories and making smarter food decisions, plus no alcohol since December 31, the approach seems to be working.
