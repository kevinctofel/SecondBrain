## Functional Programming

    Functional programming is more about declaring what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen.
    Imperative (or procedural) programming declares both the what and the how.

    In FP, we strive to make data immutable. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Mutable data, on the other hand, can be changed after it's created.
