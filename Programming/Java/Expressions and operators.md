An expression is anything that evaluates to a value.

Operators operate on operands. Operands are inputs and the result is the output. 
Operators are instructions telling the computer to do some work.

When an operator operates on its operands, the expression is evaluated to a value. For example, given the expression 3 + 5, when the addition operator (+) operates on the operands 3 and 5, the result is the value 8.

Compound Expressions are expressions composed of sub-expressions, typically with the use of parenthesis.

## Integer Division

In Java, the division operation will result in an int value if **both** of the inputs are int values.  
In Java, the division operation will result in a double value if **either or both** of the inputs are double values.
