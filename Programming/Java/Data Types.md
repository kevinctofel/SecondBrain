## General programming data types

**Boolean** - Represents only true or false values. These are used in logic expressions and decisions.

**Integer** - Represents positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part. Examples: -127, 8, 65535.

**Floating Point** - Represents positive or negative numbers with a fractional component. Examples: 3.1415, 2.0, -123.456.

**String** - Represents textual information as a sequence of encoded characters. Examples: "Hello!", "This is a String.".

## Numerical Precision

A float value has a precision of about 9 significant digits, and a double value has a precision of about 17 significant digits. It is generally best to assume that the last digit of any float or double value is rounded and may not be exact.

## Floating point literals

A floating-point literal using scientific notation is written using an e preceding the power-of-10 exponent, as in 6.02e23 to represent 6.02 x 1023. The e stands for exponent. Likewise, 0.001 is 1 x 10-3 and can be written as 1.0e-3. For a floating-point literal, good practice is to make the leading digit non-zero.
