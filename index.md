# ðŸ§  My second brain

## Who am I?

I'm Kevin C. Tofel, a 55 year old student of life and software engineering. I've previously worked at Gigaom, ZDNet, and Google. I've also sold two startup technology blogs.

## What is this?

This site is both a repository of information (mostly technical) that I want to preserve for future reference and a daily, personal journal. Not too personal though as everything I write here is publicly available.

## Where do I find my information?

I tend to be online, consuming interesting content. Like a *lot* of content. So I read specific sites daily, access others through RSS feeds, check social media and search for interesting YouTube content. I try to be intentional when searching for specific information, which makes me more productive.

## Why does this exist?

I was a professional blogger for nearly 20 years, leaving that role in early 2024. As the year progressed, I found that I missed writing and sharing interesting content. This site lets me continue doing that while also boosting my future productivity by housing important information I may later refer to.

## How do I update this site?

This may change in the future, but for now, here's how this site is designed on a technical level.

- All content is written in [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is simpler than HTML. I use the Vim text editor in Linux and/or Obsidian to create or edit content.
- All content is stored in a Github repository.
- When I commit new content to the repository, static HTML files are produced by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), which are then published to the web within seconds.
