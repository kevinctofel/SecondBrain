## [Immich](https://immich.app)

A self hosted, private alternative to Google Drive.

### Installation on UNRAID

Standard install uses 3 Docker containers but there's a simpler method that uses just two.

### Public sharing of photos or albums

My first attempt to share a photo created a link but it required an Immich login. Turns out you can create a public link (with permissions to download or not, expire after a certain time, etc...) from within the app.
