The Speediance Gym Monster offers a 4 test strength assessment for back, chest, legs, and shoulders. I took the assessment the first day I received the gym on November 26, 2025.

The following table shows the results (in pounds) of that and all subsequent tests in order to evaluate my strength gains in 2026.

|Exercise test|11/26/2025|1/4/2026|

|Barbell Squat|180|212|
|Barbell Bench Press|101|115|
|Seated Barbell Shoulder Press|88|97|
|Barbell Bent Over Row|143|146|
